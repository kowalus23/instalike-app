It's simple project, based on Firebase DB, my inspiration was Instagram. But my app is less complicated. In the future i'm planning to add some more future like:

- Modal for question if you want to delete post
- Google authorization: (Individual posts)
- Date for comments (with switch to let you know NOW/TODAY/YESTERDAY/MONTH AGO/YEAR AGO)
- Option to make a post open for comments or just for logged in users
- Name for comments (annonymous vs user.name)
- Paginations.... and more

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
fill up json with needed dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
